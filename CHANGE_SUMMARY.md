# Change Summary - July 16, 2025 (v2)

## Primary Update: Landing Page Pricing Teaser Optimization

### Issue Addressed
- **Problem**: Potential bounce rate from price-conscious visitors who might click off without scrolling to see pricing
- **Impact**: Visitors leaving before understanding the value proposition and pricing options
- **Business Goal**: Reduce bounce rate while maintaining conversion flow for Google Ads traffic

### Solution Implemented
**File Modified**: `src/pages/HomePage.jsx`

**Changes Made**:
1. **Added pricing teaser under main headline**:
   - Text: "Starting at $75/month - No Credit Check Option Available"
   - Styled with green background and border to match positive messaging theme
   - Positioned prominently between headline and subheading

2. **Visual styling**:
   - Green background (`bg-green-100`) with green border (`border-green-300`)
   - Bold text (`text-2xl font-bold text-green-800`)
   - Rounded corners and padding for professional appearance
   - Inline-block display for centered positioning

### Technical Details
```jsx
// Added after main headline
<div className="bg-green-100 border-2 border-green-300 rounded-lg py-3 px-6 inline-block mb-6">
  <p className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-800">
